# Capstone project on the use of Variables and Control structures


## What does the program do? 

* This program allows a customer or user to access financial calculators that will 
* work out the return of an investment and a repayment plan for a home loan.


## How to use the program?

* User inputs either **Bond** or **Investment** when prompted to choose between the calculators
* provided in the program

* The program will also request the user to choose between a simple and compound interest as
* it is programmed to calculate simple and compound interest but the user should choose which 
* one to use.


## What are the contents of the program?

1. The program request for an input either **Bond** or **Investment**
2. The user gives the input out
3. If the user inputs **Investment**, they will be asked to enter the amount they 
   want to deposit for how long they want their investment for and the interest rate
4. Next the program will request the user to choose between **Simple interest** and **Compound interest** 
   to work out the interest they want.
5. If the user inputs **Bond** the program will request them to enter the values of the property, 
   length of the plan in **Months** not in Years, and interest rate to work out the bond.   


## How to install the program?

* This is a program on variables and control structures that has been written in python
* and works out simple and compound interest as well as Bond. To use this program you will 
* simply need to download it to the system that you have whether it is Windows, MacOS or Linux. 
* The only python package that you will need for the program to work properly is the **math** 
* package.


## Gratitude and recognition of the organization and people involved in the program.

* Although this project has been coded solely by myself I would like to give credit to HyperionDev
* for planning the project work as part of the **Compulsory tasks** required to be completed for 
* **The Data Science Bootcamp**. 

* I also would like to **Thank** Snelisile Makhanya, HyperionDev mentor who reviewed and provided
* insightful feedback to the project.
